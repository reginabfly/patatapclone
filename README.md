# Patatap Clone

The Patatap Clone was built utilizing HTML, CSS and Paper.js library. This application was my first time using the Paper.js library and the HTML5 Canvas. 

## About The Game

When you first enter this application, all you will see is a black screen. Press any letter key and your will make a melody of sounds with an animation with circles that come and go on the screen.
